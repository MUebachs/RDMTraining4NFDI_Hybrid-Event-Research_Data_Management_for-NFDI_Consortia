  - [ ] For each section of this module, or for the module as a whole, write down the three most important things you have learned.

# Module 2: Open Science

 ### Module

 - **Title:** Open Research
 - **URL:** https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open
 - **Author(s):** The Turing Way Community
 - **Learning time:** 1 to 2.5 hours

 ### Goal(s)

 - Define open research / science.
 - Appraise the usefulness of open science.
 - Describe open access as an area of open science. 

 ### Section(s)

 [Open Access](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/open/open-access) and at least one other section. Let your fellow learners know what your main take away has been.

 ### Exercise(s)

 - [ ] Considering the stages of the [RDMkit research data life cycle](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_life_cycle) (i.e. plan, collect, process, analyse, preserve, share, reuse), could you suggest one or more open practices for each stage that are specific to your discipline? Share a sample in the [Rocket.Chat channel](https://go.rocket.chat/invite?host=all-chat.nfdi.de&path=invite%2F5uFTm4) and see what ideas others have!
 - [ ] Please answer the following questions using bullet points:

 1. What are the potential advantages of open science practices in the subject area in which your users are active? (Please specify the area.)

 2. What are the potential challenges of implementing open science practices in this subject area?

 - [ ] Write a brief profile of a tool or initiative that can be used to promote or implement open science. This could be a tool or initiative that you know about or use, or that your institution offers or is involved in. The minimum information required is: 

 - Name of the tool/initiative
 - Link
 - Assignment to the step in the research data life cycle
 - One to two sentences/key points on the extent to which it supports open science.

    This is a great opportunity to team up with others from your consortium! You can start collaborating now, or plan exchange time during the asynchronous homework phase (24 November to 5 December). If you’d rather, you’re also welcome to work independently.

    - [ ] Adapt the checklist for your own discipline by providing examples.
    - [ ] For each section of this module, or for the module as a whole, write down the three most important things you have learned.

 ### Going Beyond the Material

 - [ ] Here is the definition of Open Science from the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science:

    “[…] For the purpose of this Recommendation, Open Science is defined as an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. […]”

    Research another definition of open science from an institution or organisation that plays a significant role in your work or discipline. How does this definition differ from or resemble the one mentioned?

# Module 4: Git for Beginners

 ### Module

 - **Title:** Getting started with Git
 - **URL:** https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-git/02-getting-started.html 
 - **Author(s):** Silvia di Giorgio (Ed.), Christopher Erdmann (Ed.), Thea Atwood (Ed.), Eric Lopatin (Ed.), Drew Heles (Ed.), Eva Seidlmayer (Ed.), Katrin Leinweber (Ed.), Belinda Weaver (Ed.), Jez Cope (Ed.), James Baker, Nora McGregor, Dan Michael O. Heggø, … Wolmar Nyberg Åkerström.
 - **Learning time:** 2.5 hours

 ### Goal(s)

 **Version control** is the practice of recording and managing changes to files over time, so you can always return to earlier versions when needed. It offers powerful benefits: working concurrently without overwriting each other’s work, keeping multiple versions safely, maintaining a complete history of changes, and tracing or annotating every edit. Together, these practices make research outputs clearer, more reliable, and easier to understand.

 **Version Control Systems (VCSs)** such as Git put these practices into action. They allow research teams to manage files (such as scripts, code, and documentation) seamlessly while preserving the full story of how the work evolved.

 By adopting version control, researchers and those who support them gain a foundation for reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration, all of which are essential to trustworthy, modern research.

 In this module, you will:

 - Create a Git repository.
 - Track changes to files using the Git repository.
 - Query the current status of the Git repository.

 ### Section(s)

 Section 2. Getting Started with Git.

 ### Exercise(s)

 - [ ] Coding along: the training material contains lines of code that you are invited to try out for yourself as you work through it.
 - [ ] Checking out: https://learngitbranching.js.org/ 
 - [ ] For each section of this module, or for the module as a whole, write down the three most important things you have learned.
